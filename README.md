# Open Wisdom
A repo dedicated to providing knowledge and wisdom for all who are curious and also a collaborative approach to knowledge structuring.

We are really excited to tell you that the repo shall be only in markdown, or html to make it easy to write and not really about design.

Here you can colaborate on various observations, structures, ***frameworks, and models*** that will help humanity to think.

# Why open?
Becaues it sounds cool, and well, people colaborating together on same body of knowledge means, more trial and error and more fast progress.
